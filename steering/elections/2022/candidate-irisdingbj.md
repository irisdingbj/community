### Here's a paragraph about my contributions to Istio.

Iris has worked on Istio service mesh since 2019 and currently serves as maintainer for Environment working group, User Experience Working group and Security Working Group. She also has served as Istio steering committee member and Istio 1.6's release manager. She is actively contributing to Isito in terms of PR filing, reviewing and design discussions. She is committed to continue contributing to Istio. Some key features she contributed are:
- External Control Plane
- Multi certificate authority signer
- IPv6 and Dual Stack support
- CryptoMB support for TLS handshake

She was an co-organizer for IstioCon 2021 and 2022. She is maintaining the Istio community Bilibili(The most popular Live broadcast platform in China) account and broadcast all our IstioCon videos which attracted many users/developers into Istio project. Iris also organized the first Istio Meetup China (https://istio.io/latest/blog/2021/istio-community-meetup-china/) in July,2021 together with other partners. The meetup has 292 people registered , 140 people attended on-site in person, 2000 people watching online at peak time via Istio's Bilibili account. These activities enlarged Istio's influence in service mesh eco-system greatly.

# Here's a paragraph about why I'm running.

Iris is an open source enthusiast and is passionate about contributing and advocating for Istio in the service mesh industry and helping users adopt Istio successfully. If elected, she would love to help out with various aspects of making Istio successful, such as fostering a smooth and happy environment for developers, contributors and users, and providing neutral mediation for non-technical disputes. She would love to help new contributors to get started and get more contributions to Istio project.
